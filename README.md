SQL is a widely used programming language designed to interface with databases. Web developers and data scientists may use SQL on a daily basis in their careers. SQL functions as a method for retrieving data from within a database, and this popular method can interface with multiple programs and systems. You can use SQL to:

1. Alter data within a table
If you access a database that has organized data within a table, you can use SQL to manipulate this data. For example, you can change certain data points within the table. Additionally, you could alter every section of the table with updated data. This is a very common use of SQL.

3. Create a table
Another use of SQL is the ability to create a new table. Users may create a brand new database by adding new data into a table once it's created. This function allows users to contribute data to the system, which can further analyze, manipulate and store it.

5. Retrieve data
Many data scientists can use SQL to retrieve data from within the database. The process for this in SQL is DQL, which stands for Data Query Language. After retrieving the data, it's easier to analyze and assess it. The syntax for this command is "SELECT."

6. Change data structure
Another use of SQL is to change the structure of the data. You can do this by changing the database or table where the data's stored. A professional may use SQL for this purpose if there's new data that makes the current storage process outdated.

7. Define the database's schema
You can use SQL to define your database's schema, which contributes to data descriptions and structuring. The name of this process is data definition language, or DDL. The commands you can use for this process include "CREATE," "DROP," "ALTER," "TRUNCATE," "COMMENT" and "RENAME."

8. Manipulate the data
You can use the DML, or data manipulation language, feature to store, modify, delete or update the data. You might use SQL for this purpose if you want to refresh the whole database to ensure it's accurate and updated. The commands for this include "INSERT," "UPDATE" and "DELETE." Here's an example of how to use these commands:

9. Define user functions and procedures
Using SQL, you can add functions and procedures based on your specific database needs. For example, you can link simple SQL syntax to a specific command before you begin using the system. This helps you meet the requirements for your business and simplifies the process of using the language.

10. Analyze data manually
You can use SQL to manually analyze the data within your system. This may be necessary when you need to intervene with the system manually. While troubleshooting or solving an issue with the database, manual analysis can provide an alternative way to continue accessing the data. Users can use SQL queries to search for necessary data, which they can then use for analysis.

11. Combine datasets
The SQL Join function allows users to combine data from two sets. You might use this feature if you want to combine and compare two different tables.
